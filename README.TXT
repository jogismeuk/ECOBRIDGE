ECOBRIDGE: An automated knowledge-based workflow for spatial downscaling

Description
ECOBRIDGE (Ecology and Biodiversity Integrated Downscale Generation) is an open, knowledge-based ArcGIS Pro workflow, to produce high-resolution land cover/land use (LC/LU) maps from coarser sources. Present day mapping captures fine LC/LU details, but future/alterative LC/LU scenarios are typically constructed at coarser spatial resolution, hindering comparisons. ECOBRIDGE draws on specialist knowledge to parse a low-resolution baseline and scenario, a higher-resolution baseline and information defining LC/LU change, to generate high-resolution spatial data for the scenario.

These outputs are produced in the form of two datasets: as a raw pixel map and as an intelligent mapping layout which considers the structure of the landscape. ECOBRIDGE also facilitates the transfer of knowledge from a human-dependent expert system to an AI framework by packaging the downscaling process into a transferable deep learning model.

Installation
Add the file ECOBRIDGE.atbx to your ArcGIS Pro toolboxes (right click on Toolboxes, then Add Toolbox).  To run the downscaling workflow, right-click on the ECOBRIDGE model within the Downscaler toolset and click Open. Complete the fields with the required datasets and click Run to generate the downscaled outputs.
